1. ~~Mobile screen, Photo on first page, if it can be a bit further up so we can see all of it (for example on a iPhone 14 screen)~~

2. ~~Mobile screen, To make smaller the distance between phone number and we found a neglected treasure~~

3. ~~Make photos all the same size (as the first ones) for uniformity, except scrapbook/gallery~~

4. ~~Should we scrap scrapbook as it does not work well on mobile and do a gallery instead with photos? Also the title little scrapbook is not aligned with the other titles? Can we align it?~~

5. ~~Can we make bold the letters for the types of rooms, standard, superior etc under accommodation?~~

6. ~~Lets loose the polaroid effect and any frame for the photos and just have them without any border? Maybe this way the photos canl also be bigger?~~

7. ~~Can we add a second photo underneath the photo for the little info (laptop screen) think it will look better as it is a long text (same size photos)~~

8. ~~Can we have only the rates with the black backdrop - therefore two different text blocks?~~

9. ~~On the laptop the photos don’t move left to right, can they if they are clicked on?~~

10. ~~Loose the photo where it says so directions so we make this same size with the remaining text and add it to the previous box? Essentially make the whole thing smaller~~

11. ~~Would like to add and eat + drink section (we can gain some space by removing directions from "location and directions" on the menu?)~~

12. ~~Final big ask, can we have my little place on the hill as a permanent fixture on top of the page so that when you say open accommodation it says my little place on the hill above? (Like the hotel essencia website more on this below) on laptop and mobile?~~

13. And most importantly, if you remember we want to introduce some movement (video) and then we had the idea of sthng moving across the page (instead of a video) (have a look at hotelesencia.com they are doing it) they have some elements moving in a very simple way, like a crab on their first page ( think its cute and funky) Could we perhaps have a small cat? Or a bird? Or both? :) think that would be sooo amazing

I like the overall simplicity of that website and was wondering if ours can have a similar feel.

Also I think I had asked before, will we able to add a page/title say press at some point? Can’t remember what you said.
